		<p>Benjamin Wicks is currently 24 years old and he has lived in Omaha, NE since he was born.</p>
		<p>Ben graduated from the <a href="http://bioinformatics.ist.unomaha.edu/undergraduate.php?p=undergraduate" target="_blank">bioinformatics</a> undergraduate program at the University of Nebraska at Omaha in May of 2014. There are special places in his heart for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_(sport)" target="_blank">Ultimate Frisbee</a>, <a href="http://developer.android.com/" target="_blank">Android</a>, and <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/" target="_blank">Arduino</a>.</p>
		<p>He has been interested in human health and genetics for several years. Two of Ben's newer interests are DIY electronics and neuroscience. One field of particular interest to him is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain%E2%80%93computer_interface" target="_blank">interfacing</a> of mind and machine. What if prosthetics (of all sorts) could be developed that could interface closely with the brain and allow for very fine control?</p>
