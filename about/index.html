			<p>I am currently <span id="age">24</span> years old and I have lived in Omaha, NE since I was born.</p>
			<p>I developed an interest in genetics and later in computer science during high school. One of my favorite high school teachers recommended that he should check out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics" target="_blank">bioinformatics</a>. After graduating from <a href="http://mps.mwhs.schoolfusion.us/" target="_blank">Millard West High School</a> in May of 2010, I began my studies at <a href="http://www.unomaha.edu/" target="_blank">the University of Nebraska at Omaha</a>. I chose to <a href="http://bioinformatics.ist.unomaha.edu/" target="_blank">major in bioinformatics</a>, following the pre-medical track and taking honors courses. I graduated from the <a href="http://bioinformatics.ist.unomaha.edu/undergraduate.php?p=undergraduate" target="_blank">bioinformatics</a> undergraduate program at the University of Nebraska at Omaha in May of 2014. There are special places in his heart for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_(sport)" target="_blank">Ultimate Frisbee</a>, <a href="http://developer.android.com/" target="_blank">Android</a>, and <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/" target="_blank">Arduino</a>.</p>
			<p>I have been interested in human health and genetics for several years. One of the biggest areas of my interest is simply computer science. I took a liking to programming after I began to learn <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)" target="_blank">Java</a> in 11<sup>th</sup> grade. Two of my other big interests are DIY electronics and neuroscience. One field of particular interest to me is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain%E2%80%93computer_interface" target="_blank">interfacing</a> of mind and machine. What if prosthetics (of all sorts) could be developed that could interface closely with the brain and allow for very fine control?</p>
